Retro game sounds and themed spinner verbs for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Plays nostalgic sound effects from **StarCraft**, **Warcraft**, **Mortal Kombat**, and **Age of Empires 2** when Claude finishes a response, starts a session, sends a notification, and more. Also replaces Claude's thinking spinner with game-themed phrases.

Works on **macOS**, **Windows**, and **Linux**.

## Installation

```bash
npx claudefx
```

That's it. Pick a theme from the menu — if needed, it installs itself globally so hooks keep working.

## Available Themes

| Theme | Game |
|-------|------|
| `sc-terran` | 🚀 StarCraft: Terran |
| `sc-protoss` | 🚀 StarCraft: Protoss |
| `wc` | 🪓 Warcraft |
| `mk` | 🕺 Mortal Kombat |
| `ao2-britons` | 🏰 Age of Empires 2: Britons |
| `ao2-franks` | 🏰 Age of Empires 2: Franks |
| `ao2-turks` | 🏰 Age of Empires 2: Turks |


## Themed Spinner Verbs

Each theme also replaces Claude Code's spinner verbs with game-themed phrases. While Claude is thinking, you'll see lines like *"Spawning zerglings"* or *"Summoning ogres"* instead of the defaults.

## Usage

### Interactive menu

```

Use `↑↓` to navigate, `Enter` to select, `q` to quit.

### CLI commands

```bash
claudefx list              # list all themes
claudefx use <theme>       # apply a theme
claudefx use ao2-turks     # example
claudefx off               # disable sounds
claudefx current           # show active theme
```

## How It Works

`claudefx use <theme>` writes hooks and spinner verbs to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Claude Code triggers sounds on these events:

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `sessionstart` | A session begins |
| `stop` | Claude finishes a response |
| `question` | Claude sends a notification |
| `sessionend` | A session ends |
| `submit` | You send a message |

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- Claude Code
- **macOS**: built-in `afplay` (no extra deps)
- **Windows**: built-in PowerShell (no extra deps)
- **Linux**: `mpg123` (`sudo apt install mpg123`)
